# sqlalchemy-challenge
Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area.

## What we'll need to get started
In order to create our desired results for this project we are going to want to download a few packages. You will be using Python and SQLalchemy to create our climate analysis. Specifically, we will be using matplotlib, pandasm and SQLalchemy orm queries to do so.

# Overview
In this project we will be studying data from Hawaii for the amount of precipitation they have recieved and analysis the last 12 months. We will be going over the amount of stations throughout this area that is collecting the data and which area is recieving the most precipitation over the last 12 months. Finally, we will be using Flask to show the temperatures of certain areas around Hawaii. We will be making a JSON list to show the minimum, average, and maximum temperatures within this dataset.![output]
